# SRCL

- Global styles: import 'srcl/global.css' once in your app (recommended). You can also use 'srcl/global.scss' if your build supports Sass.
- Fonts are self-hosted and bundled via the CSS pipeline; no extra configuration is needed.

## Using SRCL via subpath exports

SRCL can be consumed as a library using subpath exports so you can import individual components directly without app-level aliases.

Examples:
- import Grid from 'srcl/components/Grid'
- import Row from 'srcl/components/Row'
- import Card from 'srcl/components/Card'
- import Button from 'srcl/components/Button'
- import Text from 'srcl/components/Text'
- import Badge from 'srcl/components/Badge'

Global styles:
- Import once in your app entry: `import 'srcl/global.css'`
- If you prefer to compile SCSS yourself, `import 'srcl/global.scss'` (subpath export) and ensure your build has a Sass pipeline.

Notes:
- Tree-shaking: Subpath imports ensure you only bundle what you use.
- Types: TypeScript declaration files are provided for components and common utilities; editors should auto-complete props.
- Peer dependencies: React and React DOM are expected to be provided by the consuming app.
- Styles: Components use SCSS modules. Most Vite-based projects work out of the box. If your build fails to resolve SCSS, install a Sass pipeline (e.g., add the `sass` package).
- Fonts: The library build copies every font referenced in `global.scss` into `dist/assets/fonts` and rewrites component CSS to import the emitted assets automatically.

Troubleshooting:
- If your bundler cannot resolve imports like 'srcl/components/Button', ensure that your installed SRCL version exposes subpath exports and your bundler supports them (Node resolution with "exports" field).
- If you see style resolution errors, add the sass dependency to your project and confirm that CSS/SCSS modules are enabled in your bundler config.


**[Live Demo](https://sacred.computer)**

SRCL is an open-source React component and style repository that helps you build web applications, desktop applications, and static websites with terminal aesthetics. Its modular, easy-to-use components emphasize precise monospace character spacing and line heights, enabling you to quickly copy and paste implementations while maintaining a clean, efficient codebase.
